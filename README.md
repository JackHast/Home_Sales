# Home Sales

## Summary

The purpose of this repository is to explore what with have learnt using pyspark. We imported a csv file that contains a range of data relating to house sales and performed as series of queries on the data using a temporary view and spark sql. We also cached the data and converted to a parquet file to see if the same query would be executed faster than if just using a pandas dataframe to hold the data which we found that it did.
